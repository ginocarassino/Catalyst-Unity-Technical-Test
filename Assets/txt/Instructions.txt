A pesky target has invaded this Unity project. Luckily, this novelty cannon just arrived. Your task is to create controls to aim the cannon, and fire hitting the target. A successful hit should give a visual indication (eg, turns green, disables, etc).

The cannonball prefab should be fired from the cannon. It will be effected by gravity so the firing should be a physics interaction.

 Bonus marks:
1. Spawn multiple targets at runtime (extra marks for including a points system).
2. Implement a 30 second timer with a visual indicator on time left (e.g UI with countdown).
3. Any extra visual feedback (e.g firing effects from the cannon).
4. Audio implementing (using free assets or creating assets).


We are looking for clean, robust, and self documenting code. You may be asked to talk through your solution.
